#### Post Workout Thoughts

I felt really strong during this workout, the initial phase was quite difficult but pushing past the initial barrier I was able to get into a rhythm and keep pushing. I feel good and I'll be ready for the easy run tomorrow

### Friday 10/13

- 45 minute easy run

#### Post Workout Thoughts

While I was running this morning I had some tightness in my hamstring while I was running and I think I didn't intake enough electrolytes before my run/last night. I am going to start focusing on fueling before my runs in the morning.

## Thoughts

This weeks workouts don't seem too hard, I don't think I'll have trouble getting through them. We'll see how well I can
hold the pace on Thursday. I'm excited and I feel ready.
