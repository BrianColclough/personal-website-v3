## My Results
 
On November 4th I ran my first ever half marathon. It was the longest I've ever run my whole life. Before I started taking running seriously, running 3+ miles every run seemed impossible. 

I ended up running a 1:50:40 (8:27/mi) half marathon, a time I'm extremely happy with for my first race. Training for and running this half marathon was extremely fun and rewarding. Not every day did I want to get out of bed and do my workout. Sometimes I missed workouts, but I still went out and achieved what I wanted which was a sub 1:55 half marathon. 

## What Went Wrong

Lets just jump right into what I could have done better. Like I said before, I missed some workouts. Mostly when I was about 6-8 weeks out and I was struggling for motivation. I wish I hadn't missed those workouts. During that time I could have gotten faster and improved my fitness even more for the race. When you're in a training block for an event like this every workout matters and you should try to do them all.

I don't think I pushed myself to my full potential during training because of these missed workouts. I also underestimated what I was capable of doing at the beginning of my training. I had never run any races before so I had no idea what race pace should feel like or how fast I should be running during training. After running this half I realized that I need to increase my race pace as I don't think it was as hard as it should have been and I know I'm capable of more.

I did not allow my body to recover properly after the half-marathon and I started running again too soon. The race was on a Saturday and I was running again on the Tuesday after. I did a speed workout the Thursday after, and during that workout I injured my foot, I'm still recovering from that now and I haven't run in about a week. I should have given my body more time to recover considering the week of the half marathon was the most weekly mileage I had done since starting training.

## What Went Right

If I was to talk to someone who was just starting to run and wanted some advice for a first race I would tell them two things:

1. Pick the right shoes
2. Fuel Properly

These are the two things I found to help me the most on this first running journey.

### Picking the Right Shoes

This was a pivotal moment in my running journey for me. When I say picking the right shoes, I do not mean going out and spending $250 on a pair of the nicest carbon plated shoes money can buy. What I'm talking about is getting shoes that fit you properly and do not cause you pain in the *long run* (get it?). 

When I was trying to get into running last year I went to a local running store where the employees measured my feet and got me into a pair of running shoes that supposedly fit me. When I started running in them though they were giving me blisters at the arch area of my foot. I initially thought this was because I needed to break in the shoes before they would fit me properly but that never happened. This really crushed my motivation for running especially since I was a beginner just getting started.

Starting this training block I still had those same shoes from last year when I had tried running but it just didn't stick. I laced them up and used them for about a month before one day I had blisters so bad on my feet I had to walk 2 miles back to my car because I could no longer run from how much pain it would cause. That same day I went back to the running store and told them my experience with the shoes. They got me fitted in a pair of **Saucony Ride 15's** (they were on sale and I didn't want to spend much). This made a huge difference for me. I was able to run and not experience any pain in my feet after, it just made everything feel easier.

### Fueling Properly For Race Day

During my training I made it a point to try out some different meals before long runs or big workouts. I was looking for what would make me feel the best during the runs, everyone is going to be different here so you'll have to do some experimentation of your own. Some things that I would look for though: 

1. Ensure the food is higher in carbs
2. Look for good fats

What I found out is eating a higher fat diet specifically for meals before runs always made me feel like I could run forever. For me having some dairy or avocados really helped me. I run in the mornings so these foods would usually be consumed the night before. 

As for run nutrition, I'm not affiliated in anyway, but I use [BPN supplements](https://www.bareperformancenutrition.com/), specifically their G1M Sport for pre-run fuel and Go gels for intra-run fuel.

## My Next Challenge

In 2024 I'm going to run a full marathon. I would like to run the Charlotte Marathon again, but that's not until November. I think I could prepare sooner for a full but I know I want to run some other races as well and I could use the in between time to try out some other distances and get my baseline PR's for them.
