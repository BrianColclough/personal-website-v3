It's now three weeks out from the Charlotte Half Marathon which takes place on November 4th. My goal for my first ever
half is to come in under 2 hours. Which means I'll be running right around a 9:05 minute per mile pace.

The thought of this use to be scary to me, but now I know I can do this. I was worried that I wouldn't even be
able to run that far when I first started, but now I know that I'll not only finish, I've made my goal more ambitious by
setting the 2-hour goal. As long as you keep getting out there and working towards your goal you will get there with consistency.

When I first started running not long ago I could barely get through one mile and in this short amount of time I've improved a massive amount. We're all capable of more than we think we are, and to learn where our potential is we have to test ourselves. 

**Thats what I want to do.**
