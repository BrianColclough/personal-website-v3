It's now three weeks out from the Charlotte Half Marathon which takes place on November 4th. My goal for my first ever
half is to come in under 2 hours. Which means I'll be running right around a 9:05 minute per mile pace.

The thought of this use to be scary to me, but now I really think I can do this. I was worried that I wouldn't even be
able to run that far when I first started, but now I know that I'll not only finish, I've made my goal more ambitious by
setting the 2-hour goal. As long as you keep getting at there and doing whatever it is you need to to work towards your
goal you will get there. Consistency is key.
