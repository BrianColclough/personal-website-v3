## My Motivation

In the years since Covid sent everyone into lockdown the home gym market has taken off. I had never really considered having a home gym up until mid-2023. For starters I never had the money to build out something that I knew would have everything I wanted. I was in college until May 2022, and after having been working for about a year and a half I realized it was something I could do at my house.

I wanted to make a home gym because I recently have been trying to be a more hybrid athlete, and I have been running 3-4 days a week. For me this leaves very little time in my schedule to drive to my gym, get a workout in, and drive home. Espically with work, and wanting to spend time with my girlfriend. This is when I realized that if could have my gym at the house that I would be able to run and lift in the same day! I have been an avid gym goer ever since I got my drivers liscence when I turned 16, so I knew that I would use my gym.
