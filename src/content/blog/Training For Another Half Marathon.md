## Its time to get serious
I decided that I’m training for another half marathon. I love having a goal that I’m trying to reach, I needed to sign up for a race to keep my motivation high. My goal for this half marathon is under 1:45. I would like to go faster, maybe 1:43, as an optimistic goal. 
I’m going to be posting weekly updates of my workouts as an accountability measure. The first one will be next Saturday 6/28
