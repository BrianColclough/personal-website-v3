# Week 1 of Training
## Sunday 6/22 - 4.5 Mile Long Run
“Long” runs for me right now that mean 4.5 miles. This use to be nothing for me, but right now this was tough. I ran 4 miles last Saturday and it wasn’t that bad. For this run though my legs were sore from weightlifting a few days before and I didn’t get the best sleep the night before so I was tired during this run. I still got it done, but it was harder than I expected.

## Monday 6/23 - 3.5 mile easy run
Today’s run felt good. I ran during lunch and it was sweltering out there. I like the feeling of running in the heat though, as long as I can manage to stay out of the sun most of the time, which I was able to by running on a greenway in the shade. I adjusted my workout plan to start with less volume each week, so I have more adjustment time. I don’t want to dive right in and get injured from overtraining, I’d rather take it slow.

## Wednesday 6/25 - Rolling 800’s
This workout was tough but great. It was only 2.5 miles, but I had to repeat an interval of 0.5 miles at 8 minute pace and 0.5 miles at 9:10 minute pace two times. This was challenging but I was able to complete this workout and feel good!

## Thursday 6/26 - 2.5 Mile Easy Run
This was a nice slow run that I did in the middle of the day in the Charlotte heat, it was like 96 degrees during this run, which made it more difficult. I like the feeling of sweating a lot though, I just need to make sure I stay hydrated.

## Reflection
This week was a nice workout week. I felt good throughout and didn’t feel overly sore or overtrained. I was feeling the training most on Wednesday night and during my Thursday run I felt some soreness, but nothing major. I’m looking forward to my training in the coming week.
