# Week Three 
## Tuesday 2.5 Miles Easy
I altered my schedule from now on to have Tuesday as my workout day instead of Monday. That way I can feel more fresh for my run after my long run on Sunday. I was just getting too sore from my long runs. This run was great I was able to keep my heart rate down and have an actual easy run.

## Thursday 2 Tempo Miles
I was excited for this workout, I knew it would be difficult, but it was an opportunity to prove my progression so far to myself. I was able to run 2 miles at 8 min pace with not too much difficulty. I was working hard, but it wasn’t everything I had.

## Friday 2.5 Mile Easy Run
This was a good run, I was feeling tired from my workout Thursday, but I was again able to keep my heart rate down for most of the run. It was creeping up by the end of this run.

## Sunday 3.75 Mile Long Run
No problem here, since this is my first de-load week of my plan 3.75 miles as a long run is no issue. I ran this easy and was still able to keep my heart rate down and have an easy run!
