# Week 2 of Training
## Sunday Long Run
This weeks Sunday long run was an epic fail. After doing a 12.5 mile mountain bike trip on Saturday I was feeling down for the Sunday run. I went out and started running only to feel sick and have to slow down. What was supposed to be a 5 mile run turned out to only be 2.5. I’m not happy I wasn’t able to complete the full 5, but I’m still glad I was out there and got some time on my feet.

## Wednesday 2.75 Mile Easy Run
This was another hot day, I ran in the afternoon and it was probably 92 or so out there. It was a solid workout and I felt good during it, although I was running slower than I expected. 

## Thursday Hill Runs
This run was so hard 6 hill run repeats. I think this will help down the line, but man it was hot and the hill was punishing.
