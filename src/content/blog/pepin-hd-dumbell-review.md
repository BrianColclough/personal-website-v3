## Introduction

The Pepin HD series dumbbells are a set of adjustable dumbbells that do not prioritize the speed of changing weights. They are similar to IronMaster dumbbells where you have to change plates on either side of the dumbbell and then add a screw to keep the weights on the handle. Also Pepin dumbbell is not a large company, they are a small shop with a high attention to detail, so cost is going to be higher compared to ironmaster, powerblock, neuobell, etc.

Just around the time of writing this pepin has partnered with REP Fitness to bring the pepin fast series into Reps lineup. I don't know if Pepin and Rep plan on introducing more dumbells with this collaboration, but the dumbbells I'm refering to here are the dumbbells ordered directly through Pepin.

## Why HD Series

I chose the HD series because I wanted a dumbbell that felt like a fixed weight dumbbell. I have the Rep Quickdraw dumbells for my girlfriend and I have used them for a few weeks. While they are nice dumbells if you are someone who wants to go over 60 pounds or even want to use 50-60 pounds they get pretty large and what I didn't want in my dubbells and somethign that lots of other adjustables struggle with is the weights jiggling around.
